#Abstract
In the digital age, personal data privacy has become a critical concern, driven by the proliferation of online platforms and the increasing volume of data storage. This thesis explores the challenges and methodologies surrounding digital erasure, with a particular focus on compliance with privacy regula- tions such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). The work investigates machine learning techniques, especially Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers, to track, match, and prepare personal data for deletion across complex systems. By adapting intrusion recovery methodologies, this research proposes a system for accurately identifying and managing data marked for deletion, ensuring organizations can meet regulatory obligations. The analysis demonstrates how machine learning models are particularly effective for matching data, with this thesis focusing specifically on the identification and matching of logs as a crucial step in the broader process of data deletion. This thesis contributes to the broader discourse on data privacy by addressing the practical challenges of data management in distributed environments, paving the way for an initial approach for what would be one of the steps in order to obtain a more secure and compliant data deletion.
